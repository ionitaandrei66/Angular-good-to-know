-> Creational (Object Creation)

Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point (e.g., for logging, configuration).

Factory/Factory Method: Decouples object creation from the client, letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate (e.g., creating different types of vehicles).

Builder: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, separating construction from representation (e.g., building a complex User object).

-> Structural (Object Composition)

Adapter: Makes incompatible interfaces work together (e.g., connecting a new library to an old system).

Decorator: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without altering their code (e.g., adding features to a coffee like milk, sugar).

Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem (e.g., a simple API for a large framework).

-> Behavioral (Object Interaction)

Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency where multiple objects (observers) are notified of state changes in another (subject) (e.g., weather station updates).

Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable (e.g., different sorting algorithms).

Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, or logging of requests (e.g., undo/redo functionality).
